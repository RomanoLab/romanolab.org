        <h1>Knowledge-driven biomedical data science</h1>
        <p>
            Our lab focuses on using <i>structured biomedical knowledge</i> to answer interesting questions in biomedicine. We're particularly interested in applications to environmental toxicology. Some of our favorite methods are multimodal graph machine learning and applied ontology inference.
