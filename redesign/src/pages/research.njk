    <p>
        ComptoxAI is a data infrastructure for AI research in computational and predictive toxicology. At its core, ComptoxAI contains a large, graph formatted knowledge base describing chemicals of toxicological concern, human diseases, and the complex network of biomedical interactions that mediate mechanisms of toxicity.
