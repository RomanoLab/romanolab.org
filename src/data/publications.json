    "abstract": "Molecular machine learning has broad applications across multiple domains such as drug development, environmental toxicology, and materials science. Various pre-trained frameworks using self-supervised representation learning have emerged to tackle the difficulty of obtaining large molecular datasets useful for training high-performing molecular machine learning models. In this study, we explore a novel representation learning framework trained using both 2D and 3D molecular data. Specifically, a 3D invariant graph neural network to learn how to capture 3D atomic information and then pass these atomic representations into a regular 2D graph neural network which can leverage molecular topology. Results from experiments demonstrate the representations produced by our method using both 3D and 2D molecular information lead to strong performance in downstream tasks."

    "abstract": "Background: As global populations age and become susceptible to neurodegenerative illnesses, new therapies for Alzheimer disease (AD) are urgently needed. Existing data resources for drug discovery and repurposing fail to capture relationships central to the disease’s etiology and response to drugs. Objective: We designed the Alzheimer’s Knowledge Base (AlzKB) to alleviate this need by providing a comprehensive knowledge representation of AD etiology and candidate therapeutics. Methods: We designed the AlzKB as a large, heterogeneous graph knowledge base assembled using 22 diverse external data sources describing biological and pharmaceutical entities at different levels of organization (eg, chemicals, genes, anatomy, and diseases). AlzKB uses a Web Ontology Language 2 ontology to enforce semantic consistency and allow for ontological inference. We provide a public version of AlzKB and allow users to run and modify local versions of the knowledge base. Results: AlzKB is freely available on the web and currently contains 118,902 entities with 1,309,527 relationships between those entities. To demonstrate its value, we used graph data science and machine learning to (1) propose new therapeutic targets based on similarities of AD to Parkinson disease and (2) repurpose existing drugs that may treat AD. For each use case, AlzKB recovers known therapeutic associations while proposing biologically plausible new ones. Conclusions: AlzKB is a new, publicly available knowledge resource that enables researchers to discover complex translational associations for AD drug discovery. Through 2 use cases, we show that it is a valuable tool for proposing novel therapeutic hypotheses based on public biomedical knowledge."

AIDTox accurately predicts cytotoxicity outcomes in HepG2 and HEK293 cells.

    "abstract": "The characterization of complex diseases remains a great challenge for biomedical researchers due to the myriad interactions of genetic and environmental factors. Network medicine approaches strive to accommodate these factors holistically. Phylogenomic techniques that can leverage available genomic data may provide an evolutionary perspective that may elucidate knowledge for gene networks of complex diseases and provide another source of information for network medicine approaches. Here, an automated method is presented that leverages publicly available genomic data and phylogenomic techniques, resulting in a gene network. The potential of approach is demonstrated based on a case study of nine genes associated with Alzheimer Disease, a complex neurodegenerative syndrome. The developed technique, which is incorporated into an update to a previously described Perl script called \"ASAP,\" was implemented through a suite of Ruby scripts entitled \"ASAP2,\" first compiles a list of sequence-similarity based orthologues using PSI-BLAST and a recursive NCBI BLAST+ search strategy, then constructs maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees for each set of nucleotide and protein sequences, and calculates phylogenetic metrics (Incongruence Length Difference between orthologue sets, partitioned Bremer support values, combined branch scores, and Robinson-Foulds distance) to provide an empirical assessment of evolutionary conservation within a given genetic network. In addition to the individual phylogenetic metrics, ASAP2 provides results in a way that can be used to generate a gene network that represents evolutionary similarity based on topological similarity (the Robinson-Foulds distance). The results of this study demonstrate the potential for using phylogenomic approaches that enable the study of multiple genes simultaneously to provide insights about potential gene relationships that can be studied within a network medicine framework that may not have been apparent using traditional, single-gene methods. Furthermore, the results provide an initial integrated evolutionary history of an Alzheimer Disease gene network and identify potentially important co-evolutionary clustering that may warrant further investigation."

We present VenomKB, a new publicly accessible knowledge base and website that aims to act as a repository for emerging and putative venom therapies. Presently, it consists of three database tables: (1) Manually curated records of putative venom therapies supported by scientific literature, (2) automatically parsed MEDLINE articles describing compounds that may be venom derived, and their effects on the human body, and (3) automatically retrieved records from the new Semantic Medline resource that describe the effects of venom compounds on mammalian anatomy.

    "abstract": "Background: A typical task in bioinformatics consists of identifying which features are associated with a target outcome of interest and building a predictive model. Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems such as the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) constitute an appealing approach to this end. However, in biomedical data, there are often baseline characteristics of the subjects in a study or batch effects that need to be adjusted for in order to better isolate the effects of the features of interest on the target. Thus, the ability to perform covariate adjustments becomes particularly important for applications of AutoML to biomedical big data analysis. Results: We developed an approach to adjust for covariates affecting features and/or target in TPOT. Our approach is based on regressing out the covariates in a manner that avoids 'leakage' during the cross-validation training procedure. We describe applications of this approach to toxicogenomics and schizophrenia gene expression data sets. The TPOT extensions discussed in this work are available at https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot/tree/v0.11.1-resAdj. Conclusions: In this work, we address an important need in the context of AutoML, which is particularly crucial for applications to bioinformatics and medical informatics, namely covariate adjustments. To this end we present a substantial extension of TPOT, a genetic programming based AutoML approach. We show the utility of this extension by applications to large toxicogenomics and differential gene expression data. The method is generally applicable in many other scenarios from the biomedical field. Keywords: AutoML; Covariate adjustment; Feature importance; Genetic programming; Pathways."

In spite of their successes, little guidance exists on when to use one versus the other. Furthermore, relatively few tools exist that allow the integration of both AutoML and ANNs in the same analysis to yield results combining both of their strengths. Here, we present TPOT-NN—a new extension to the tree-based AutoML software TPOT—and use it to explore the behavior of automated machine learning augmented with neural network estimators (AutoML+NN), particularly when compared to non-NN AutoML in the context of simple binary classification on a number of public benchmark datasets. Our observations suggest that TPOT-NN is an effective tool that achieves greater classification accuracy than standard tree-based AutoML on some datasets, with no loss in accuracy on others. We also provide preliminary guidelines for performing AutoML+NN analyses, and recommend possible future directions for AutoML+NN methods research, especially in the context of TPOT."

We demonstrate that DTox can achieve the same level of predictive performance as conventional models with a significant improvement in interpretability. Using DTox, we were able to rediscover mechanisms of transcription activation by three nuclear receptors, recapitulate cellular activities induced by aromatase inhibitors and pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonists, and differentiate distinctive mechanisms leading to HepG2 cytotoxicity. Virtual screening by DTox revealed that compounds with predicted cytotoxicity are at higher risk for clinical hepatic phenotypes.

Specifically, we focus on liver cancer as a case study with diverse underlying mechanisms that are clinically significant. Our approach uses two complementary AI techniques: Generative modeling via automated machine learning and genetic algorithms, and graph machine learning. We used data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Adverse Outcome Pathway Database (AOP-DB; aopdb.epa.gov) and the UK Biobank's genetic data repository. We use the AOP-DB to extract disease-specific AOPs and build graph neural networks used in our final analyses. We use the UK Biobank to retrieve real-world genotype and phenotype data, where genotypes are based on single nucleotide polymorphism data extracted from the AOP-DB, and phenotypes are case/control cohorts for the disease of interest (liver cancer) corresponding to those adverse outcome pathways. We also use propensity score matching to appropriately sample based on important covariates (demographics, comorbidities, and social deprivation indices) and to balance the case and control populations in our machine language training/testing datasets. Finally, we describe a novel putative risk factor for LC that depends on genetic variation in both the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 11 (ABCB11) genes."

However, their use may lead to unintended, negative medical outcomes commonly referred to as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These effects vary widely in mechanism, severity, and populations affected, making ADR prediction and identification important public health concerns. Current methods rely on clinical trials and postmarket surveillance programs to find novel ADRs; however, clinical trials are limited by small sample size, whereas postmarket surveillance methods may be biased and inherently leave patients at risk until sufficient clinical evidence has been gathered. Systems pharmacology, an emerging interdisciplinary field combining network and chemical biology, provides important tools to uncover and understand ADRs and may mitigate the drawbacks of traditional methods. In particular, network analysis allows researchers to integrate heterogeneous data sources and quantify the interactions between biological and chemical entities. Recent work in this area has combined chemical, biological, and large-scale observational health data to predict ADRs in both individual patients and global populations. In this review, we explore the rapid expansion of systems pharmacology in the study of ADRs. We enumerate the existing methods and strategies and illustrate progress in the field with a model framework that incorporates crucial data elements, such as diet and comorbidities, known to modulate ADR risk. Using this framework, we highlight avenues of research that may currently be underexplored, representing opportunities for future work."

Advances in informatics and computational biology have increased productivity at many stages of the drug discovery pipeline. Nevertheless, drug discovery has slowed, largely due to the reliance on small molecules as the primary source of novel hypotheses. Natural products (such as plant metabolites, animal toxins, and immunological components) comprise a vast and diverse source of bioactive compounds, some of which are supported by thousands of years of traditional medicine, and are largely disjoint from the set of small molecules used commonly for discovery. However, natural products possess unique characteristics that distinguish them from traditional small molecule drug candidates, requiring new methods and approaches for assessing their therapeutic potential. In this review, we investigate a number of state-of-the-art techniques in bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and knowledge engineering for data-driven drug discovery from natural products. We focus on methods that aim to bridge the gap between traditional small-molecule drug candidates and different classes of natural products. We also explore the current informatics knowledge gaps and other barriers that need to be overcome to fully leverage these compounds for drug discovery. Finally, we conclude with a \"road map\" of research priorities that seeks to realize this goal."

However, there are likely to be patterns arising from complex genetic architectures which are more easily detected and modeled using machine learning methods. Unfortunately, selecting the right machine learning algorithm and tuning its hyperparameters can be daunting for experts and non-experts alike. The goal of automated machine learning (AutoML) is to let a computer algorithm identify the right algorithms and hyperparameters thus taking the guesswork out of the optimization process. We review the promises and challenges of AutoML for the genetic analysis of complex traits and give an overview of several approaches and some example applications to omics data. It is our hope that this review will motivate studies to develop and evaluate novel AutoML methods and software in the genetics and genomics space.

    "abstract": "The progress of precision medicine research hinges on the gathering and analysis of extensive and diverse clinical datasets. With the continued expansion of modalities, scales, and sources of clinical datasets, it becomes imperative to devise methods for aggregating information from these varied sources to achieve a comprehensive understanding of diseases. In this review, we describe two important approaches for the analysis of diverse clinical datasets, namely the centralized model and federated model. We compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses inherent in each model and present recent progress in methodologies and their associated challenges. Finally, we present an outlook on the opportunities that both models hold for the future analysis of clinical data."

    "abstract": "Network representations of data are designed to encode relationships between concepts as sets of edges between nodes. Human biology is inherently complex and is represented by data that often exists in a hierarchical nature. One canonical example is the relationship that exists within and between various -omics datasets, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, among others. Encoding such data in a network-based or graph-based representation allows the explicit incorporation of such relationships into various biomedical big data tasks, including (but not limited to) disease subtyping, interaction prediction, biomarker identification, and patient classification. This review will present various existing approaches in using network representations and analysis of data in multiomics in the framework of deep learning and machine learning approaches, subdivided into supervised and unsupervised approaches, to identify benefits and drawbacks of various approaches as well as the possible next steps for the field."
