    <h2>Knowledge-driven biomedical data science</h2>
    <canvas id="graph-banner"></canvas>
    <p>
        We are a new biomedical research team launching in early 2023 at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania's</a> <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu">Perelman School of Medicine</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We use <b>structured biomedical knowledge</b> and <b>artificial intelligence</b> to answer important questions in biomedicine. We're particularly interested in applications to environmental toxicology. Some of our favorite methods include multimodal graph machine learning and applied ontology inference.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peripheral areas of interest include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Natural product drug discovery</li>
        <li>Genetic programming / evolutionary algorithms</li>
    </ul>
