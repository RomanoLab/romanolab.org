Chloé's work seeks new discoveries in understudied areas of maternal health using graph machine learning and multimodal data analysis. Before enrolling in her PhD studies at Penn, she earned her bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

Prior to joining the lab as a long-term member, Chloé completed a research rotation with us in which she used link prediction on heterogeneous knowledge graphs to predict new associations between chemicals of toxicological concern and specific human diseases, the results of which will soon be available as a major data resource to the scientific community.
