Please join us in welcoming two new members to the lab! **Estefania Morales** and **Kevin Shen** are undergraduate students conducting research at the intersection of cheminformatics, environmental toxicology, and machine learning.

Estefania is an undergraduate student from Tufts University majoring in biochemistry. She comes to Penn for Summer 2023 as an intern in the Summer Undergraduate Internship Program (SUIP) - a highly competitive program that allows undergraduate students with interests in pursuing academic research the chance to work in a research lab aligned with their interests. Estefania's project in the lab is focused on using explainable machine learning to better understand predictions made through quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for endpoints of chemical toxicity.

Kevin is an incoming first year undergraduate student at Penn, where he intends to declare a major in genomics and computational biology. His research will focus on improving computational representation of chemicals to enhance the accuracy of machine learning models trained to predict specific toxic activities. Kevin has already completed research in biomedical informatics - as a high school student, he worked in Dokyoon Kim's lab (also at Penn), where he received recognition from the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) as part of the High School Scholars Program.
